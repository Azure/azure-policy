By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys (CMK) are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.
